# Simple clock and alarm clock

#### This program was finished in 2016,when I am at first grade in university. To improve my ability of programing ,I choose to use raw C++ code rather than using  STL .

#### It is only valuable for learning, but not for applying. So do some other projects in my github.

#### At the first page you can choose a function you need.It includes a clock with clock pointers，a digital clock and a alarm-clock.

#### It is a dynamic digital clock and you can transfer to the clock with clock pointers by inputting 'K' ,turn to home page by inputting 'B' and shut down the music by inputting 'S'.
